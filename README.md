The genres I watned to mix were: jet flying + trick score Tony Hawk ish games (or ssx)


You are a pilot of a jet. To win this game you have to obtain 5000 points in 60 seconds.

You get the points by drifting. Drifting at high speed or close to the objects multiplies the score. To get even higher score you can do special moves: cobra flip (basically a flip) and barrel roll. Those special moves highly multiplies your current score of the current trick. That score will be added to the global score after sometime without drifting. 

If you fly into something you loose your current score for the current move.

## Controls:

* W/S - **Thrusting**
* A/D - **Yawn**
* UP/DOWN - **Pitch**
* Left/Right - **Roll**

## Disclamer:

This code is very bad, don't try to understand what is happening there. It was tough to think of an idea, create it, programm it, create assets, sfx, vfx and so on only in 2 days. That's the cost of game jams tho. So ya know don't expect best practices here
